Through CardioML, the used machine learning approach 
provides specific features to evaluate heart attack risks by 
investigating combined data of age and blood pressure and 
cholesterol level and behavioural patterns. Multiple 
machine learning approaches serve for heart disease data 
prediction to enhance their prediction accuracy and medical 
intervention decisions. Numerous studies about the topic 
show that ML algorithms succeed in diagnosing cardiac 
diseases with remarkable precision. The classification of 
cardiac diseases through clinical data happens through three 
different analytical methods consisting of logistical 
regression and support vector machines and neural 
networks. The system requires reinforcement through 
additional appropriate features together with precise data 
processing methods. The combination of HMM with DL 
techniques currently reaches medical classification 
accuracy of more than 85%.
